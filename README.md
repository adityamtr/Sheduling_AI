# Transcript Analysis Application

This application provides a Streamlit-based interface for interacting with a scheduling AI assistant that analyzes user-uploaded or database-retrieved transcripts to extract meeting times, availability, preferences, and action items. It includes secure login functionality and conditionally renders personalized content based on user-specific data.

## üîß Setup Instructions

> **Note**: Python 3.12 is recommended for compatibility with all features and dependencies.

1. **[Optional] Create and activate a virtual environment**
   - This is recommended but optional based on your development setup.
   ```bash
   # Linux / Mac
   python3.12 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate

   # Windows
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Navigate to the application source directory**
   > The application_source directory is the source root.
   ```bash
   cd /application_source
   ```

3. **Set the PYTHONPATH to include the application source**
   - This ensures all modules can be properly located and imported.

   ```bash
   # Linux / Mac
   export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)

   # Windows (Command Prompt)
   set PYTHONPATH=%cd%

   # Windows (PowerShell)
   $env:PYTHONPATH = (Get-Location).Path
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Secrets configuration**
   - Manually create a folder named `secrets` in the root directory (in application_source).
   - Place the provided secret files (you will receive them separately) inside the `secrets/` folder.
