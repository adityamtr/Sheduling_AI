**Meeting Start**:
**Customer**: Hi Jim, how’s it going?

**Sales Rep**: Hey Mike! Everything’s good. I just got off the phone with the printer techs, and they’re doing well. How can I help you today?

**Customer**: Well, I’ve been using your paper for a while now, and I’m looking to stock up on some Bond Paper. Do you have any deals or promotions on that?

**Sales Rep**: Absolutely, Mike. Our Bond Paper (ProductE) is always a hit. We’re running a special right now where it’s 15% off. It’s a great time to grab some!

**Customer**: That sounds good. What kind of discounts do you offer for bulk orders? And what’s the minimum quantity needed?

**Sales Rep**: For bulk orders, we offer a 10% discount per carton. The minimum order is 50 cartons. We can definitely send you an updated pricing sheet if you’re interested.

**Customer**: Sure, that would be helpful. Also, I remember having some issues with print quality before. Have things improved since then?

**Sales Rep**: Yes, Mike. We’ve made significant improvements in our fulfillment process. Quality control is top-notch now. As for compatibility, we test everything with various printers to ensure smooth printing.

**Customer**: Great to hear that. Can you show me some samples? I’d like to see them before making a decision.

**Sales Rep**: Of course, Mike. We can arrange that. By the way, do you mind if I send you an updated pricing sheet? It might help you make a better choice.

**Customer**: No problem at all. Thanks for the offer.

**Sales Rep**: Anytime, Mike. Just let me know when you’re ready to place your order. We’ll get those samples sent over as well.

**Customer**: Sounds good. I’ll give you a call in a few days to finalize everything.

**Sales Rep**: Perfect, Mike. I’ll be here waiting. Take care!

**Customer**: Will do. Thanks, Jim.

**Sales Rep**: You’re welcome! Talk to you soon.

**Customer**: Bye.

**Sales Rep**: Bye, Mike.
