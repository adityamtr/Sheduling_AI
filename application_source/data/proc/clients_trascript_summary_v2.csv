**Customer**: Hi Dwight, how’s everything going?

**Sales Rep**: Hey Katrina! Everything’s good here. I hope you’re doing well too. How can I assist you today?

**Customer**: Hi Dwight. I’ve been using your paper products for quite some time now. I’m looking to replenish my stock, especially since we ran out of Matte Paper last month. Have you got any deals or promotions on that?

**Customer**: Hi Andy, it's Samantha here. I hope you're doing well.

**Sales Rep**: Hi Samantha! Great to hear from you. How can I assist you today? Do you have any updates on your paper supply situation?

**Sales Rep**: Absolutely, Robert. Our Recycled Paper (ProductC) has been quite popular, and we’re currently offering it at a 12% discount as part of a limited-time promotion. It’s perfect for those who want to reduce waste while maintaining quality.

**Customer**: That sounds great. But I do remember having some issues with delayed deliveries last quarter. Have things improved since then?

**Sales Rep**: I’m glad you brought that up, Robert. We’ve made significant improvements in our fulfillment timelines. Delivery times are now much more consistent. 

**Customer**: Good to hear that. Can you tell me more about the compatibility with different printers? And do you have samples available for us to check out?

**Sales Rep**: Of course, Robert. Our Recycled Paper is compatible with most printers, including high-end models. As for samples, we can certainly send you some for testing. Just let me know what sizes and quantities you’d like.

**Customer**: Perfect. And just to clarify, what are the delivery times and the minimum order requirement for bulk pricing?

**Sales Rep**: For standard shipping, we offer free shipping on orders over $50. Delivery times range from 3 to 5 business days. For bulk pricing, we require a minimum order of $100. This helps us manage inventory efficiently and ensure timely deliveries.

**Customer**: Sounds good. Could you send me an updated pricing sheet so I can review all the options?

**Sales Rep**: Of course, Robert. I’ll prepare that right away and get it to you within the next day. In the meantime, if you have any other questions or concerns, feel free to reach out.

**Customer**: Thanks, Andy. I appreciate your help. I’ll definitely be placing an order soon.

**Sales Rep**: No problem at all, Robert. I’ll keep in touch and follow up in a few days to see if you need anything else. Take care!
